Brute.java vs. Fast.java.
___________________________________

Brute.java

-----------------------------

Brute.java is O(n^4).

Brute.java has to crawl through four nested for loops, and within these nested loops, it will find the slopes of lines AB, CD, and DA.  It then checks to see if the slopes of these lines match the slope given, and if it is true, then we know they lie on the same line.  
This process is very time consuming, especially when n is quite big.  An n of 1000 could take as much as 40-50 minutes to execute.  Therefore, this was a very slow algorithm.


Fast.java
-------------------------------

Fast.java is O(2*n^2).  

Fast, not surprisingly, was a lot faster.  It was done by taking the arctangent to find angles, and then comparing them.  I was able to get it down to two nested loops.  Inside the first loop there are two individual loops that do separate tasks, which would give us 2*n for that.  So, the two inner loops within the one outter woud give us 2n^2, which is much better than using our brute force method.
